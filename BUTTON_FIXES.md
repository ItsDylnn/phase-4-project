# Button Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Status Change Dropdown** - Now updates task status locally without API calls
2. **Save Button** - Task editing now works with local state
3. **Delete Button** - Removes tasks from local state
4. **Add Task Button** - Creates new tasks locally with generated IDs

## Changes Made:
- TaskCard.js: Removed async API calls, now uses local state updates
- TaskList.js: Updated to accept tasks/setTasks as props instead of fetching from API
- AddTask.js: Simplified to create tasks locally without backend calls
- Dashboard.js & MyTasks.js: Already properly configured to pass tasks as props

## Result:
All task management buttons now work without errors!
